# Applying Supervised Learning to predict student dropout
Evaluating student demographics, engagement and performance metrics for predicting dropout likelihood using supervised learning techniques - Neural Networks &amp; Decision Trees.


## ðŸ”¸ Data
The data used in this project was divided into 3 stages, each representing the students' progression through their academic journey, starting with enrollment details, followed by incorporating engagement metrics and finally introducing subject gradings.

## ðŸ”¸ Methodology
* Performed data exploration and the necessary preprocessing steps, including encoding and scaling.
* Identified the key correlations between variables.
* Defined, compiled and trained the Neural Network models.
* Performed hyperparamater optimisation using Keras Tuner to further refine accuracy.
* Instantiated and trained the Extreme Gradient Boosting models.
* Applied Grid & Ramdom-Search to further tune the XGBoost models.
* Calculated and compared the models' perfomances across a range of metrics [Accuracy, AUC, Recall & Precision].

## ðŸ”¸ Tools
* Python, NumPy, Pandas
* Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* Keras-Tensorflow & Keras Tuner
* XGboost & Sklearn's GridSearch Cross Validation
